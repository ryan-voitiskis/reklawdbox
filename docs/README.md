- `reference/` — stable technical references used across features.
- `developer/` — implementation constraints and patterns for contributors.
- `operations/runbooks/` — operational procedures for running or recovering systems.
- `operations/sops/` — agent SOPs for repeatable workflows.
- `operations/reports/` — dated execution reports and test sessions.
- `rekordbox/` — standalone Rekordbox knowledge corpus and tooling (kept as-is).
