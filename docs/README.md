# Documentation Index

`docs/` is organized by purpose and lifecycle:

- `reference/` — stable technical references used across features.
- `operations/runbooks/` — operational procedures for running or recovering systems.
- `operations/sops/` — agent SOPs for repeatable workflows.
- `operations/reports/` — dated execution reports and test sessions.
- `integrations/` — integration-specific docs (provider setup, plans, handover notes).
- `rekordbox/` — standalone Rekordbox knowledge corpus and tooling (kept as-is).

Compatibility note: `docs/rekordbox-internals.md` is retained as a legacy path because the untouched `docs/rekordbox/` corpus references it.
