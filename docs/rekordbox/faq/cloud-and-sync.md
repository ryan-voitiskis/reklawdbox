### I've started rekordbox CloudDirectPlay, however sometimes tracks are not appearing on the browse screen and I can't seem to load tracks. Why is this?

There are possible causes as follows.

- **Cloud Sync is incomplete**
  If the Cloud Library Sync between rekordbox and the library in the cloud hasn't finished, the track won't be displayed on the browse screen. Wait for the sync to finish, then the track should display.
- **The music file has not been uploaded to cloud storage (Dropbox or Google Drive)**
  Only music files that you have uploaded to cloud storage will be displayed on the Browse screen.
  If the upload is not complete, the music file cannot be loaded.
  Upload the music files you want to use to cloud storage beforehand, then use them once the upload is complete.
  You can upload with rekordbox.
- **Impact of cloud storage maintenance or failure**
  When cloud storage is undergoing maintenance or experiencing problems, music files cannot be loaded. Try again when the cloud storage is back online.
  You can check the status of these issues on the cloud storage service websites below.

### Track titles are grayed out on my computer and I can't play them.

3. In rekordbox (Mac/Windows), click [SEARCH MOBILE].
4. Select the track from a track list in rekordbox (Mac/Windows) and right-click to show the context menu. Select [Mobile Library Sync] > [Transfer to this computer].

- Using Cloud Library Sync

### When Auto Upload is enabled, some of the tracks in some of my playlists won't upload to the cloud. Why not?

Instead, upload the track from the PC/Mac or mobile device where it's stored.

---

### When using Cloud Library Sync, rekordbox responds slow.

---

### When I synced multiple devices using Cloud Library Sync, the same track showed up twice in the track list.

You can select [Tracks stored on the computer] or [Tracks stored on other devices] in the Cloud column to remove unwanted tracks by filtering them.
Syncing the same track on multiple devices with Cloud Library Sync after importing the same track on each device results in duplication. You can determine which device the track is from by filtering by [Tracks stored on the computer] or [Tracks stored on other devices] in the cloud column. Then you can delete the tracks you don't want.

---

### Cannot log in to Dropbox or Google drive.

When using Firefox, you may experience issues logging in to Dropbox or Google drive.
