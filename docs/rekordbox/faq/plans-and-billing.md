### If I change my subscription to the monthly payment option in the middle of a yearly payment cycle, will you refund the rest of my yearly payment?

In any of the following cases, we'll refund the balance of the paid annual payment, based on the number of months that have elapsed up to the date of the plan change:

- When you upgrade to the monthly Creative or Professional plan from the yearly Core plan
- When you upgrade to the monthly Professional plan from the yearly Creative plan

It usually takes about 3 to 7 days to receive the refund, which comes via the same payment method you used to purchase your subscription.

| ---------------- | ------ |

- If you're changing from the Creative plan to the Professional plan
- if you add the Cloud Option to the Core plan, or Creative plan

In any of the following cases, the change will be applied on the next renewal date:

- When you switch between monthly and yearly payment options for the same plan
- When you switch from the Creative to Core plan
- When you switch from the Professional to the Creative or Core plan
- When you cancel the Cloud Option for the Core plan and Creative plan

What's the "next renewal date"?

Suppose you started a plan on the 10th of the month. If you change the plan between the 1st and 9th (inclusive) of a month, the next renewal date is the 10th of the current month.

If you change plans on the 10th or any following day until the end of the month, the renewal date is the 10th of the next month.

For a yearly plan, it will be the same date one year after the start of the subscription (however, if the first contract date is February 29 of a leap year, it will be February 28 of the following year).

For example, if you started a monthly plan on June 15 and you switch to a yearly payment option for the same plan on September 20, the next renewal date will be October 15.

*Disclaimer: renewal dates may differ due to time zone differences, etc.
