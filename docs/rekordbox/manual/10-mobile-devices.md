# Using mobile devices to prepare for DJ performance

You can export analyzed tracks, created playlists, My Settings, etc. to a mobile device (such as iPhone and Android(TM) device) by wireless LAN. Also, music data that has been edited on the mobile device can be copied to rekordbox.

**Note**

- rekordbox must be installed on the mobile device. The mobile device version of rekordbox can be downloaded from websites such as App Store and Google Play(TM).
- For connecting to a wireless LAN, refer to the operating instructions of your mobile device, computer, and wireless LAN device.

## Connecting a mobile device supporting wireless LAN (Wi-Fi(R))

On [Devices] in the tree view of the browser panel, rekordbox music files can be transferred not only to USB storage devices and SD memory cards, but also to mobile devices (e.g. iPhone, Android(TM) devices) that support wireless LAN (Wi-Fi(R)).
Set the mobile version of rekordbox on the mobile device to the communications standby mode, and then click [icon] at the bottom of [Media Browser]. After this, connect the mobile device to the computer by following the instructions on the screen.

**Hint**

- For instructions and details on rekordbox functions on the mobile device, refer to the rekordbox website.
- Open the [Preferences] window > [View] category > [Layout] tab and uncheck the [SEARCH MOBILE Button] checkbox of [Media Browser]. [SEARCH MOBILE] is not displayed.

# Using tracks on other computers and mobile devices

By using the Cloud Library Sync function, tracks and playlists from other computers and mobile devices can be synced to your computer via a cloud storage service.
For more details, refer to "Cloud Library Sync Operation Guide" on the rekordbox website.
