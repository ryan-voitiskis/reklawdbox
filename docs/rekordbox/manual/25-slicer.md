# Using a slicer

The specified range is divided into 8 sections, which are assigned to the respective performance pads. If you click and hold a performance pad, the sound divided for the section and assigned to that pad plays as a loop.

During the loop play of the pad, the normal playback with the original rhythm continues in the background. When the pad is released and loop playback ends, playback resumes from the position reached at that point.

**Hint**

- For the screen, see "[SLICER] mode" (page 129).
- The slicer function can be used with tracks for which beat grid is set. For setting beat grids, see "Checking the beat (beat grid)" (page 151).

1. Load a track to a deck.

2. Shift the playback position to a point where you wish to set a slicer, and pause.

3. Select [SLICER] on the performance pad.
   Click [loop icon] to switch to the slicer loop mode.
   Use [left arrow]/[right arrow] to shift the start position.

4. Click [range decrease] or [range increase] to select the slicer range.
   The range selected is divided equally into 8 sliced sections, which are assigned to each pad as displayed below.

   **Sliced sections 1 through 8**

   | Section 1 | Section 2 | Section 3 | Section 4 |
   | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
   | Section 5 | Section 6 | Section 7 | Section 8 |

5. Click to [play icon] in the JOG panel.

6. Click and hold the pad.
   While the pad is held, the assigned section plays in a loop.
   The length of the loop play differs according to the setting at the loop playback length (ROLL).
   The loop playback length (ROLL) can be set in the range from 1/64 to 1/8 of the value of slicer range (LENGTH).

7. Release the click.
   The track returns to the position that has been playing in the background.

8. Click [left arrow]/[right arrow].
   The range of the slicer is moved.
   The change depends on the value of slicer range (LENGTH).

9. Select any function other than [SLICER] on the performance pad to cancel slicer mode and slicer loop mode.

## Slicer mode and slicer loop mode

- Slicer mode:
  When the playback position reaches the end of a slicing range that has been divided into 8 sections, the range displayed on the screen changes to the next slicing range that is to be divided in 8 sections. These sliced sections are assigned to the respective pads, replacing the previously assigned sections.

- Slicer loop mode:
  When the playback position reaches the end of a slicing range, the playback position returns to the beginning of the same range.
