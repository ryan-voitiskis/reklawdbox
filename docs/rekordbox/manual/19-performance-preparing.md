# Using with DJ equipment

Connect the computer to the DJ equipment (DJ controller or DJ player) with a USB cable to control rekordbox on the DJ equipment. Refer to the Instruction Manual of connecting DJ equipment.
Be sure to read "Safety Precautions" and "Connections" in the Instruction Manual for the DJ equipment before connecting the equipment to your computer.
The latest information on DJ equipment supporting rekordbox is available on the rekordbox website and pioneerdj.com.

**Note**

- When a DJ player is connected via LAN with PRO DJ LINK, use EXPORT mode. For more details, see "Using the LAN connection" (page 109).
- You may be unable to properly operate the device depending on the USB connection status. This could be due to the bandwidth of the USB port and the USB hub on your computer. Changing the USB hub or port may solve the problem.
- For details, refer to the Instruction Manual for the DJ equipment. pioneerdj.com/en/support/documents/

## Using Ableton Link

Even when there is no direct connection between DJ equipment via cables, BPM can be synchronized with the supported equipment and applications on the same local network. This allows you to make compositions and music sessions easily. You can also use the MIDI LEARN function. For details on the MIDI LEARN function, see the "MIDI LEARN Operating Guide" on the rekordbox website.
Click [LINK] in the global section to enable Ableton Link.
To sync the BPM of Ableton link to the track loaded on the deck, turn on [LINK] in the track information panel.
Open the [Preferences] window > [Controller] category > [Others] tab > [Ableton Link], and click the [Show the Ableton Link subscreen when Ableton Link is enabled.] button. The following display will be shown when [LINK] in the global section is on. You can also display the following screen by right-clicking on [LINK] in the global section and selecting [Show Ableton Link window].

**Hint**

- To disable Ableton link, click [LINK] in the global section again.
