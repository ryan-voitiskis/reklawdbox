# Unlock a smoother DJ experience with the new rekordbox

Easier to use than any DJ software we've ever made

Prepare and perform with ease.

## Platform refresh and newly designed GUI

By streamlining various internal processes, we've significantly enhanced the performance of the software and its built-in features. And inheriting the design philosophy of rekordbox ver. 6, while changing the key color to blue, we've revised the GUI to enhance consistency with our hardware.

[Image: rekordbox ver.7 GUI screenshot showing the refreshed blue interface design]

- Uses less battery power
- Reduction in CPU processing load: Up to 56 % less
- Power consumption reduction: Up to 38 % lower

## New software learning, cloud, and automation technology.

Significantly reduces prep time

### Intelligent Cue Creation

Add a track to your rekordbox collection and the software will automatically set up Hot Cues and Memory Cues the way you like. Songs with Hot Cue and Memory Cue settings are registered in a playlist for learning. The software learning of rekordbox ver.7 picks up on trends, so the usual cue point positions are automatically reflected in other songs, making advance preparation much easier.

### Collection Radar / Streaming Radar

Discover similar tracks to any selected track from your collection or a streaming service.

[Image: Collection Radar interface showing similar track recommendations]

### Detection of Vocal Position

Using AI technology, rekordbox accurately detects and analyzes vocal positions within any track. Vocal detection results are displayed on the top of the overall waveform when a track with analyzed vocal positions is loaded to the deck.

[Image: Waveform display with vocal position detection overlay]

### Intelligent Playlist

rekordbox can fill playlists with tracks similar to the ones you've chosen by automatically matching genres, BPM, keys, artist names, comments, and more.

## Streamlined preparation and a new era for your DJ workflow.

Enjoy an exponential boost in your productivity

### DUAL PLAYER

Quickly check the compatibility of tracks and find the best mix points using Dual Player layout, now available in Export mode. The operations of 2 players are linked when Dual Player is turned on via the dedicated button so you can play/pause, move through waveforms, and control Beat Jump for both tracks simultaneously. And with EQ Kill, Key Sync, and Key Shift control, there are even more ways to experiment with different tracks so you can make them sound perfect together.

[Image: Dual Player layout in Export mode showing two linked waveforms]

### Column View

If you've used the Column view in the Mac Finder, you'll be familiar with the new Column View in rekordbox ver. 7. This hierarchical structure enables you to browse playlists and playlist folders while visually checking their hierarchy, offering an intuitive way to search for folders and files, and to select and navigate through multiple playlists and tracks.

[Image: Column View browser showing hierarchical playlist navigation]

### Collaborative Playlist

Share playlists with your friends and DJ peers. Metadata, such as the order of songs in the list, BPM, grids, and cue points, can be included,* allowing you to share information for a wide range of purposes, including preparing for back-to-back sets or considering set lists for festivals.

If you share a playlist that includes tracks from a streaming service, anyone who wants to use the playlist will need a subscription for the same streaming service. If you share a playlist containing tracks stored locally on your PC/Mac, the tracks won't be available to the other collaborator until they purchase the music themselves.

## Discover music faster than ever before with the updated browse feature.

Efficiently discover the music you want to play from vast collections and diverse sources

### 5 Types of Screen Layout

Choose your favorite from 5 different screen layouts for both Export and Performance mode.

[Image: Five different screen layout options displayed side by side]

### Media Browser

The Media Browser, which has changed from a tree view to an icon view, gives you access to your chosen tracks in the shortest time possible while scouring various sources for you.

[Image: Media Browser with icon view showing multiple media sources]

### Collection Filter

Rapidly find tracks from your collection -- no matter how large it is -- with the new Collection Filter. Filter songs by date, genre, artist, or album.

[Image: Collection Filter interface with filter options for date, genre, artist, and album]

### Sub Browser

Improve your workflow by simultaneously viewing 2 collection screens for managing your collections, playlists, and folders.

[Image: Sub Browser showing two collection screens side by side]

### New Browsing Experience with Streaming Services

You can now display tracks from streaming services with a focus on the artist's image and album artwork for a more intuitive, visual browsing experience. To find more music in the style you like, simply click on one of the links for an album or playlist, such as the artist's name or label, to view a list of related tracks.

[Image: Streaming service browsing interface with artist images and album artwork]

## Make innovative live mashups and remix tracks on the fly.

Build unique live sets with more precise mixing and diverse song progressions branching out from a single track.

### MIX POINT LINK

With no need to press the play button, Mix Point Link frees up your hands (and time) for more creative things like making mashups and using effects.

[Image: Mix Point Link interface showing linked mix points between tracks]

### STEMS

Using your own music library, you can get more creative in your performances: e.g., craft mixes that overlap vocals from different tracks, part by part, or loop only the synthesizer phrases.

[Image: STEMS separation interface showing vocals, instruments, bass, and drums]

---

## Access your latest library anytime, anywhere, from PC/Mac, smartphones, and CloudDirectPlay-compatible DJ equipment.

### Cloud Library Sync

Upload tracks from rekordbox to your linked Dropbox or Google Drive account, which you can freely access from each device signed in to the same rekordbox account. This enables seamless and efficient management of tracks, playlists, Hot Cues, and other information across different devices.

[Image: Cloud Library Sync diagram showing sync between PC, mobile, and cloud storage]

### CloudDirectPlay

Music files uploaded to cloud storage beforehand can be downloaded and played on LAN-connected CloudDirectPlay-compatible DJ equipment. Cloud Library Sync is used for song uploads, enabling direct library access from DJ equipment.

[Image: CloudDirectPlay setup showing cloud storage connected to DJ equipment via LAN]

## Dramatically accelerated track analysis and highly accurate music metadata.

Reduced preparation time with our lightning-fast track analysis.

### Cloud Analysis

When rekordbox is connected to the internet, it can retrieve track analysis information from an AlphaTheta server, greatly reducing the time needed to analyze BPM, beatgrid, waveforms, and vocal positions.

- Cloud Analysis on: 26 % reduction
- Cloud Analysis off (baseline)
- *own research

[Image: Bar chart comparing analysis speed with Cloud Analysis on vs off]

### BPM/Grid Analysis

Our proprietary algorithms analyze each track's BPM and grid with exceptional accuracy, ensuring you have a precise understanding of your music's rhythm, tempo, and beat position. If you're not happy with the automatic analysis, you can manually adjust the BPM and grid.

[Image: BPM and grid analysis display on a track waveform]

### Key/Phrase Analysis

Our industry-leading key detection engine accurately identifies song keys, even in intricate rhythms and tempo changes. Choose from two display options: Classic and Alphanumeric. Phrase analysis allows you to instantly grasp the track structure visually and anticipate its development. This enables seamless mixing and track selection, and helps with phrase editing.
