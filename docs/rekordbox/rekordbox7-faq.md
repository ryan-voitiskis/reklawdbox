### If I change my subscription to the monthly payment option in the middle of a yearly payment cycle, will you refund the rest of my yearly payment?

In any of the following cases, we'll refund the balance of the paid annual payment, based on the number of months that have elapsed up to the date of the plan change:

- When you upgrade to the monthly Creative or Professional plan from the yearly Core plan
- When you upgrade to the monthly Professional plan from the yearly Creative plan

It usually takes about 3 to 7 days to receive the refund, which comes via the same payment method you used to purchase your subscription.

### The BeatGrids and Cue points on the streaming service are misaligned. How can I fix the misalignment?

BeatGrids and CUE points may need to be reset due to the possibility of the BeatGrids and CUE points shifting when [Streaming Audio Quality]* is changed.
*Access [Preferences] > [Advanced] categories > [Others] tab to set the [Streaming Audio Quality] for [Spotify], [SoundCloud], [Beatport], [Beatsource], or [TIDAL].
The [Streaming Audio Quality] settings are shared and applied on the devices that are logged in with the same Beatport account or Beatsource account.
Additionally, after updating, BeatGrids and Cue points may be misaligned for Apple Music tracks (analyzed with ver. 7.2.7 or earlier) and SoundCloud tracks (analyzed with ver. 7.2.9 or earlier).

If the BeatGrids and Cue points have shifted, reanalyze the tracks and reset the Cue points.

- For Spotify tracks, you cannot select the [Analyze Track] option in the context menu. Select [Remove from rekordbox] from the context menu first, then reload the track into the deck to have it reanalyzed. After that, set the CUE points again.

* BeatGrids and phrases
  Analyse the tracks.
  The BeatGrid and phrase positions can also be adjusted and changed manually.
  (For details, see "[GRID/PHRASE EDIT] panel" in the Instruction Manual.)
* For CUE points such as Hot Cues and Memory Cues
  Delete the CUE points before resetting them.

Hint: Method used to reanalyze multiple tracks at once

1. Select [Collection], click the icon on the [Attribute] column header, add a check to the checkbox for the streaming service with the tracks you wish to reanalyze, and click OK.
2. Select the tracks you wish to reanalyze (multiple can be selected at a time) and select [Analyze Track] from the right-click menu to reanalyze the tracks.

---

### BeatGrids and CUE points misaligned for SoundCloud tracks.

The audio quality and format of SoundCloud tracks have been changed.
Therefore, BeatGrids and CUE points analyzed prior to ver. 7.2.9 may be misaligned.

If you notice any misalignment, please reanalyze the tracks and reset the CUE points.
Also, changing the [Streaming Audio Quality] setting may cause BeatGrids and CUE points to misalign.

For details, please see [here](https://rekordbox.com/en/support/faq/streaming-7/#faq-q700146).

### I can’t use tracks with the audio quality set in [Streaming Audio Quality] on SoundCloud.

Depending on the tracks, the selected sound quality may not be available.

If Standard Quality is unavailable, the track will be analyzed and played back in High Quality;
if High Quality is unavailable, it will be analyzed and played back in Standard Quality.

### What is [Use FX1 and FX2 as FX SEND/RETURN] of [BEAT FX] in PERFORMANCE mode? (v7 [Preferences] > [Controller] category > [Effect] tab)

This is shown only when an FX SEND/RETURN compatible DJ equipment*1 is connected and selected as the audio device.

When you select this option, FX (e.g. ECHO or REVERB) tails can be heard even after pulling the channel fader of the mixer all the way down.
Please note that FX1 and FX2 must be set to the same mixer channel in this case.
This is because both of the FX1 and FX2 are routed to [FX SEND/FX RETURN] audio routing of the mixer.

When you unselect this option, the FX1 and FX2 are independently routed to the internal audio routing of rekordbox.
Therefore you can set the FX1 and FX2 to separate mixer channels.
However, FX tails can NOT be heard even after pulling the channel fader of the mixer all the way down.

*1 FX SEND/RETURN compatible DJ equipment:

DJM-V10
DJM-V5

### I exported tracks and playlists from rekordbox ver. 7 to a USB storage device, but when I connect the device into the CDJ-3000X, I cannot browse the tracks or playlists. The device works fine on other players.

The CDJ-3000X can browse tracks and playlists on a USB storage device only if OneLibrary (formerly Device Library Plus) has been exported to that device.
Follow the steps below to export OneLibrary.

Note: If you are using XDJ-AZ, OPUS-QUAD, or OMNIS-DUO, export OneLibrary using the same procedure as for the CDJ-3000X.

OneLibrary Export Procedure

1. Update rekordbox ver. 7 to the latest version
   In rekordbox, go to [Help] menu > [rekordbox update manager] to perform the update.
2. Launch rekordbox and connect a USB storage device into your PC/Mac
3. In the Media Browser, go to [Devices] > your USB storage device name, right-click [OneLibrary], and select [Convert from Device Library].
   ![](https://cdn.rekordbox.com/files/20251224094129/Convert-device-library-en.png)

This operation exports a OneLibrary with the same content as the existing Device Library to the USB storage device.

After that, you will be able to browse tracks and playlists on the CDJ-3000X just as you can on other players.

From then on, whenever you export tracks or playlists to a USB storage device, the files will be automatically added to both the existing Device Library and the OneLibrary.

Caution: If you convert when OneLibrary already exists on the USB storage device, it will be overwritten. As a result, any playlists or playback histories stored only in OneLibrary will be lost.
For more details, please refer to the "[USB Export Guide](https://cdn.rekordbox.com/files/20251021171528/USB_export_guide_en_251007.pdf)".
